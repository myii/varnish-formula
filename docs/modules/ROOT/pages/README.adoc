A simple SaltStack formula to install and configure Varnish.

This formula has been developed distributing id and state declarations
in different files to make it usable in most situations. It should be
useful in scenarios ranging from a simple install of the packages
(without any special configuration) to a more complex set-up.

== General customization strategies

First, *see if providing pillar data is enough for your customization
needs* That's the recommended way and should be enough for most cases.
See that sometimes there's a key named `extra_conf` that's used to add
arbitrary configuration lines in the templates provided.

When providing pillar data is not enough for your needs, you can apply
the _Template Override and Files Switch_ (TOFS) pattern as described in
the documentation file `TOFS_pattern.md`.

== Available states

=== `varnish`

Installs the varnish package, and starts the associated varnish service.

=== `varnish.conf`

Configures the varnish package.

=== `varnish.repo`

Adds the varnish official repositories.

== Next-generation, alternate approach

The following states provide an alternate approach to managing Varnish.
Tested in Ubuntu 14/16 and CentOS 6/7.

=== `varnish.ng`

Meta-state for inclusion of all ng states.

=== `varnish.ng.install`

Install varnish itself from custom-repo or stock-repo.

=== `varnish.ng.repo`

Install the packagecloud.io varnish repo. Repos available can be found
in https://packagecloud.io/varnishcache[packagecloud.io]

=== `varnish.ng.config`

Configure varnish (vcls and init files).

=== `varnish.ng.service`

Manage varnish and varnishncsa service.

== Varnish NG considerations

Because of the different OSes with different init programs (ubuntu14 -
init, ubuntu 16 - systemd, centos 6 - init, centos 7 - systemd), the
following considerations must be taken into account:

* VCL files must be copied to minions using `salt://` (see
pillar.example vcl section):

[source,yaml]
----
varnish:
  ng:
    vcl:
      files:
        default:
          path: /etc/varnish/default.vcl
          source_path: salt://hostname/default.vcl.jinja
        mobile_detect:
          enabled: False
          path: /etc/varnish/mobile_detect.vcl
          source_path: salt://hostname/mobile_detect.vcl
----

* Config files (`/etc/default/varnish`, `/etc/sysconfig/varnish` or
`/etc/varnish/varnish.params`) can be copied with `salt://` or just
creating the variables in the `config_file` option:

[source,yaml]
----
varnish:
  ng:
    config_source_path: salt://hostname/varnish.jinja
----

or

[source,yaml]
----
varnish:
  ng:
    config_file:
      NFILES: "131072"
      MEMLOCK: "82000"
      NPROCS: "unlimited"
      RELOAD_VCL: "1"
      VARNISH_VCL_CONF: "/etc/varnish/default.vcl"
      VARNISH_LISTEN_PORT: "6081"
      VARNISH_ADMIN_LISTEN_ADDRESS: "127.0.0.1"
      VARNISH_ADMIN_LISTEN_PORT: "6082"
      VARNISH_SECRET_FILE: "/etc/varnish/secret"
      VARNISH_MIN_THREADS: "50"
      VARNISH_MAX_THREADS: "1000"
      VARNISH_STORAGE_SIZE: "100M"
      VARNISH_STORAGE: "malloc,${VARNISH_STORAGE_SIZE}"
      VARNISH_TTL: "120"
      DAEMON_OPTS: "-a ${VARNISH_LISTEN_ADDRESS}:${VARNISH_LISTEN_PORT} -f ${VARNISH_VCL_CONF} -T ${VARNISH_ADMIN_LISTEN_ADDRESS}:${VARNISH_ADMIN_LISTEN_PORT} -p thread_pool_min=${VARNISH_MIN_THREADS} -p thread_pool_max=${VARNISH_MAX_THREADS} -S ${VARNISH_SECRET_FILE} -s ${VARNISH_STORAGE}"
----

* In CentOS 6, it must be explicitely defined the `install_from_repo`
option because in the CentOS 6 repos it is the 2 version:

[source,yaml]
----
varnish:
  ng:
    lookup:
      repo: 'varnish41'
    install_from_repo: True
----

* For the Ubuntu 16 there is a problem regarding the usage of the
systemd; there is no other way than editing the systemd varnish unit
file to modify the init options (CentOS 7 has also systemd but there is
the `varnish.params` to bypass the edition of the unit file directly). A
little trick to automate this, is using the following pillar:

[source,yaml]
----
varnish:
  ng:
    lookup:
      repo: 'varnish41'
      config: /etc/systemd/system/varnish.service
    config_source_path: salt://hostname/varnish-systemd
----

Being `varnish-systemd` the varnish systemd unit file:

[source,ini]
----
[Unit]
Description=Varnish Cache, a high-performance HTTP accelerator

[Service]
Type=forking

# Maximum number of open files (for ulimit -n)
LimitNOFILE=131072

# Locked shared memory - should suffice to lock the shared memory log
# (varnishd -l argument)
# Default log size is 80MB vsl + 1M vsm + header -> 82MB
# unit is bytes
LimitMEMLOCK=85983232

# On systemd >= 228 enable this to avoid "fork failed" on reload.
#TasksMax=infinity

# Maximum size of the corefile.
LimitCORE=infinity

# Set WARMUP_TIME to force a delay in reload-vcl between vcl.load and vcl.use
# This is useful when backend probe definitions need some time before declaring
# configured backends healthy, to avoid routing traffic to a non-healthy backend.
#WARMUP_TIME=0

ExecStart=/usr/sbin/varnishd -a :6081 -T localhost:6082 -f /etc/varnish/default.vcl -S /etc/varnish/secret -s malloc,120m
ExecReload=/usr/share/varnish/reload-vcl

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
----

So you can edit and have the file managed by salt.

* Varnish versions from 6 (including it) have change the systemd unit
service; are OS agnostic (see
https://varnish-cache.org/docs/trunk/whats-new/upgrading-6.0.html#packaging-changes[packaging
changes]).

For Debian Family OSes can use the previous trick (changing the unit
service).

For RedHat Family OSes there is a new variable `version` that setup an
`override.conf` for the default varnish systemd service that allow to
use the `varnish.params` file. For example, to install varnish 6 LTS:

[source,yaml]
----
varnish:
  ng:
    lookup:
      repo: 'varnish60lts'
    version: '6'
    install_from_repo: True
    enabled: True
    config_source_path: salt://hostname/varnish.params.jinja
    vcl:
      files:
        default:
          path: /etc/varnish/default.vcl
          source_path: salt://hostname/default.vcl.jinja
----

This change is compatible with other varnish versions (there is no error
if not set).

== Testing

Linux testing is done with `kitchen-salt`.

=== Requirements

* Ruby
* Docker

[source,bash]
----
$ gem install bundler
$ bundle install
$ bin/kitchen test [platform]
----

Where `[platform]` is the platform name defined in `kitchen.yml`, e.g.
`debian-9-2019-2-py3`.

=== `bin/kitchen converge`

Creates the docker instance and runs the `template` main state, ready
for testing.

=== `bin/kitchen verify`

Runs the `inspec` tests on the actual instance.

=== `bin/kitchen destroy`

Removes the docker instance.

=== `bin/kitchen test`

Runs all of the stages above in one go: i.e. `destroy` + `converge` +
`verify` + `destroy`.

=== `bin/kitchen login`

Gives you SSH access to the instance for manual testing.
